## Basic Setup
**How to Setup Telegram Bot:**
1. Create a Telegram Bot:
Open the Telegram app and search for the "BotFather" bot.
Start a chat with BotFather and use the /newbot command to create a new bot.
Follow the instructions to set up your bot and obtain the API token.
2. Get Your Chat ID:
Start a chat with your newly created bot.
Visit the following URL in your web browser, replacing <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN> with the actual token you obtained:
bash
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
Look for the "chat" object within the response. The "id" field in that object is your chat ID.
3. Get your TELEGRAM USER ID (This is very important to ensure you are the only user authorized to use the bot
Access https://t.me/userinfobot and this will return your TELEGRAM_USER_ID

**Repository Installation:**
1. Git Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools.git`

**Preparation**
1. Get the `config.py` file https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools/blob/main/config.py
2. You need to change the lines to your configuration. `nano config.py`

        PATH_TO_UMBREL = "YOUR-FULL-PATH-TO-UMBREL"
        # Path to your elements wallets:
        BCK_SOURCE_PATH = "/home/<user>/app-data/elements/data/liquidv1/wallets"
        # Any external folder, external storage device where you want to place the backup:
        BCK_DEST_PATH = "/mnt/backup/liquid"
        # Chat ID: https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates:
        CHAT_ID="CHAT_ID"
        NODE="NODE NAME"

        # Please check if it is the right path for your BOS Binary:
        FULL_PATH_BOS = "/home/<user>/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/balanceofsatoshis/"
3. SAVE `CTRL+O` and Exit `CTRL+X`
4. Now you need your telegram User ID, please keep it safe for you ONLY.
5. Access https://t.me/userinfobot type `/start` and this will return your TELEGRAM_USER_ID

**How to Setup**
1. Open lntools-bot.py file `nano lntools-bot.py`
2. Change Line 8 sys.path.append('/path/to/nr-tools/') to your path, if you cloned it on your user it should be `/home/user/nr-tools/`
3. Change Lines:
        .# Insert your Telegram bot token
        .TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN"
        .#Get it on https://t.me/userinfobot
        .TELEGRAM_USER_ID = "YOUR-TELEGRAM-USER-ID" 
        .BOS_PATH = "path_to_your_BOS_binary"
4. SAVE `CTRL+O` and EXIT `CTRL+X`

Now you can run it `python3 lntools-bot.py`
To run on the background you can use `screen` or setup it as a service: `screen -S lntools-bot python3 lntools-bot.py`

## [htlcScan.sh](https://github.com/jvxis/nr-tools/blob/main/htlcScan.sh)
This script checks for pending stuck htlcs that are near expiration height (< 13 blocks). It collects peers of critical htlc and disconnects / reconnects them to reestablish the htlc. Sometimes htlcs are being resolved before expiration this way and thus costly force closes can be prevented.

**How to Setup:**
1. open the code: `cd nr-tools` and `nano htlcScan.sh`
2. Include your Bot Token and Chat ID to receive telegram messages
3. Replace the line 26 `_CMD_LNCLI="/path_to_umbrel/scripts/app compose lightning exec -T lnd lncli"` with your Umbrel diretory Path
4. Optionally set up the `blocks_til_expiry=13` on line 75 to a higher number
5. Save the Script - CTRL + O
6. Leave the editor - CTRL + X
7. Make the script an executable: `sudo chmod +x htlcScan.sh`
8. Setup CRON to run the script every 30 minutes - `sudo crontab -e`
9. Add the line: `*/30 * * * * /bin/bash /home/<USER>/nr-tools/htlcScan.sh`
10. CTRL + O to save and CTRL + X to leave editor

**Done!**

4. Setup with the size that you usually restart LND on line 7 `threshold_size="12000000000"`
5. Replace lines 41 and 48, where is /path_to_umbrel with path for your Umbrel Directory
6. Save the Script - CTRL + O
7. Leave the editor - CTRL + X
